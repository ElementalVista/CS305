*Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

-Artemis Financial is a financial company that needed more secure ways to transfer data between their clients and servers, and they wanted help fixing security problems in their system.


*What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

-I successfully found and fixed security issues by using AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 checksums. Secure coding is crucial to prevent data breaches and protect a company’s reputation and client trust.


*Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

-The hardest part was finding a balance between security and performance, but learning more about encryption and validation techniques was really helpful.


*How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

-I improved security by adding AES-256 encryption, SHA-256 checksums, switching to HTTPS, and adding input validation. In the future, I would use tools like OWASP Dependency Check and code reviews to spot issues.


*How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

-I made sure everything worked by doing tests, scanning for security problems, and checking the software after updating the code to make sure no new issues appeared.


*What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

-Tools like AES encryption, SHA-256, HTTPS, and regular security testing will be useful in future projects.


*Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

-I can show how I used AES encryption, SHA-256 checksums, and secure communication methods to demonstrate my ability to develop secure software.
